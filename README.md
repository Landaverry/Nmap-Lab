# Nmap-Lab
Using Nmap to perform Host discovery &amp; fingerprinting across a number of devices on a personal network
Nmap Scanning & Networking Mapping - 
This project aims to use the Nmap network mapping tool within a Kali Linux to poke around a vulnerable web server & other personal machines that I deployed via virtual box. The goal of this side project is to be able to identify the virtual machine through my Kali Linux instance and explore what vulnerabilities can be exploited. Additionally, I will be exploring the additional options that nmap offers such as OS finger printing and service version detection.
